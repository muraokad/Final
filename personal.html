		<h1>Aur Saga</h1><p>made with <a href="http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/programs/rpg-maker-vx-ace">RPG Maker VX Ace</a>.</p>

		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Aur Saga is a single player RPG set in a beautiful world. A game i made for the Indie Game Maker Contest in 2015. Most of my time was focused on creating a serene setting that was both a tranquil yet inviting setting. A heavy emphasis on exploration and piecing together the world and strategy to defeating the creatures that inhabit this mysterious world.</p>
